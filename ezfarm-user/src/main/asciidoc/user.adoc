= Introduction

RESTful Notes is a RESTful web service for creating and storing notes. It uses hypermedia
to describe the relationships between resources and to allow navigation between them.



[[getting_started_running_the_service]]
== Running the service
RESTful Notes is written using https://github.com/alstjr9396/msa-ezfarm[MSA-Ezfarm Readme] which
makes it easy to get it up and running so that you can start exploring the REST API.

The first step is to clone the Git repository:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/alstjr9396/msa-ezfarm/tree/master/ezfarm-user
----

Once the clone is complete, you're ready to get the service up and running:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd msa-ezfarm/ezfarm-user
$ ./mvnw clean package
$ java -jar target/*.jar
----

You can check that the service is up and running by executing a simple request using
cURL:

//include::{snippets}/health-check/1/curl-request.adoc[]

== Create a user

To create a user, you need to execute a `POST` request to this URI including a JSON
payload containing the email, name and pwd of the user:

include::{snippets}/create-a-user/1/http-request.adoc[]

The response from this request should have a status code of `201 Created`
and response with the user’s details in its body:

include::{snippets}/create-a-user/1/http-response.adoc[]

== Get a user

To get a user, you need to execute a 'POST' request to this URI including a JSON
payload containing the email and pwd of the user:

include::{snippets}/login-the-service/2/http-request.adoc[]

The response from this request should have a status code of `200 OK` and contain a
`token` header that will use for Authorization the user:

include::{snippets}/login-the-service/2/http-response.adoc[]

Now that you've login the service and can request a details of yours. As you saw above,
the header is including the JWT token for performing a `GET/POST` request:

include::{snippets}/get-a-user/2/http-request.adoc[]

This request will produce a response with the user’s details in its body:

include::{snippets}/get-a-user/2/http-response.adoc[]
